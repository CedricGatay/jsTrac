Cross Origin Ressource Sharing configuration for Apache


First of all, make sure that the module "mod_headers" is activated in your Apache configuration. Then, either in your configuration file, or in a .htaccess add the following lines:


Header add Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
Header add Access-Control-Allow-Methods "POST"
Header add Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Content-Type"
Header add Access-Control-Allow-Credentials "true"


First line: Specify which domain can access your resource. If you use authentication to the server, then replace the wildcard by the actual distant domain.

Second line: Allowed method. Mimic use POST.

Third line: Allowed header in preflight. Mimic will put "Content-type"

Fourth line: Allow credentials. Might not be needed if you allow anonymous submitting.
